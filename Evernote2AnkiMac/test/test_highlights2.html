<h1>BOVINE RESPIRATORY DISEASE COMPLEX (BRD)</h1>
<small>BLACKWELL’S FIVE-MINUTE VETERINARY CONSULT RUMINANT (2009)</small>
<p><img src="?hash=35d3707c9a36823c9686f670fdbaaeed" /> <b>BASICS</b></p>
<p><b>OVERVIEW</b></p>
<p>• Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex refers to the general development of respiratory disease in cattle. In most cases, it specifically refers to respiratory disease outbreaks among multiple animals. BRD most commonly occurs in cattle fed for slaughter, although it can also occur in cattle raised for milk production.</p>
<p>• BRD is commonly called “shipping fever.”</p>
<p>• It is estimated that over $3 billion are spent annually on prevention, treatment, and production losses related to BRD in the United States fed cattle industry.</p>
<p>• The <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true">etiology</span> of BRD is very often multifactorial, and <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">may include viruses, bacteria, parasites, nutrition, environmental stressors, and host susceptibility</span>. The severity of BRD outbreaks is often influenced by the relative combination of these factors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNALMENT</b></p>
<p>• BRD can occur <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">in any age and class of cattle</span>.</p>
<p>• Y<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">ounger animals under stressful conditions are most at risk</span>.</p>
<p><b>SIGNS</b></p>
<p>• Clinical signs may vary depending on the agents involved and the severity of infection.</p>
<p>• The <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">first sign often recognized is a reduction in appetite</span>. Cattle may not show typical enthusiasm for coming to the feed bunk when fed.</p>
<p>• Cattle off feed may have a sunken appearance in the left para lumbar fossa as a result of decreased rumen fill.</p>
<p>• Affected animals often separate from their herd mates.</p>
<p>• Movement of affected animals is typically slower than nonaffected herd mates. They may show a reluctance to rise.</p>
<p>• A general appearance of depression is often appreciated.</p>
<p>• Affected cattle often stand with their heads down and extended.</p>
<p>• Cattle may have a serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge.</p>
<p>• Serous ocular discharge is often present.</p>
<p>• Coughing is often evident, especially when cattle are forced to move.</p>
<p>• Depending on the severity, shallow to labored and rapid breathing may be evident.</p>
<p>• Cattle affected with BRD typically have a fever ranging from 103.5°F to 105.5°F.</p>
<p>• A cranial ventral distribution of lung sounds consistent with bronchopneumonia and lung consolidation is found on auscultation. Moist crackles are heard with bronchopneumonia when the bronchi contain watery secretion or exudation. As the exudate thickens, the sound changes to a dry crackle. Consolidated areas of lung associated with bronchopneumonia (or large abscesses) contain no air and are completely silent.</p>
<p><b>CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS</b></p>
<p>• Viruses commonly implicated in BRD include <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza-3 (PI-3), bovine respiratory corona virus (BRCV), and adenoviruses</span>.</p>
<p>• Bacteria commonly involved in BRD include <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;"><em>Mannheimia haemolytica</em> (formerly <em>Pasteurella haemolytica</em>), <em>Pasteurella multocida</em>, <em>Mycoplasma bovis</em>, <em>Haemophilus somnus,</em> and</span> <em><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">Actinomyces pyogenes</span>.</em></p>
<p>• Environmental factors that increase the risk of BRD include <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">poor sanitation, poor ventilation, overcrowding, lack of adequate feed bunk space, lack of adequate water availability</span>.</p>
<p>• Stressful events such as <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">transportation, mixing of cattle from multiple sources, castration, dehorning, vaccination, starvation, and weaning</span> increase the risk of BRD developing.</p>
<p><img src="?hash=dde1066f89a73d6ac9eda991e0ea84d3" /> <b>DIAGNOSIS</b></p>
<p><b>DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</b></p>
<p>• Allergic interstitial pneumonia</p>
<p>• Pulmonary edema</p>
<p>• Pleuritis</p>
<p>• Pulmonary fibrosis</p>
<p>• Lungworms</p>
<p><b>CBC/BIOCHEMISTRY/URINALYSIS</b></p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p><b>OTHER LABORATORY TESTS</b></p>
<p>Culture and antimicrobial sensitivity are often done on lung samples collected at necropsy or following transtracheal bronchial alveolar lavage.</p>
<p><b>DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES</b></p>
<p>• Nasal swabs are of limited value, as many of the pathogens involved in BRD inhabit the nasal passages normally.</p>
<p>• Transtracheal bronchial alveolar lavage will identify pathogens most likely involved with pneumonic process.</p>
<p>• Necropsy provides the most useful information on the etiological agents and pathological processes involved. Necropsies on cases early in the course of the disease and prior to antibiotic therapy yield the best results.</p>
<p><b>GROSS FINDINGS</b></p>
<p>• Gross lesions will depend on the pathological agents involved in the BRD outbreak and the chronicity of the disease process.</p>
<p>• Necrotizing lesions of the upper respiratory tract and trachea may be present.</p>
<p>• Pneumonic lesions are typically distributed in a bilateral cranial ventral pattern, often with a sharp line of demarcation between the normal and abnormal lung.</p>
<p>• There may be varying degrees of pleural adhesion between lung lobes and to the chest wall.</p>
<p>• The lung parenchyma typically has a lobulated pattern that imparts a marbled appearance both on the pleural and cut surface.</p>
<p>• Affected parenchyma is firm in palpation and may range in color from pink to tan to red to red-black depending on the amount of necrosis present.</p>
<p>• Necrotic tissue may progress to abscessation.</p>
<p><b>HISTOPATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS</b></p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p><img src="?hash=def03add5d38f401f2def1be6ac2fe6a" /> <b>TREATMENT</b></p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">• Antimicrobials directed against common BRD bacteria.</span></p>
<p>• Moving sick cattle to separate pens may be indicated to reduce the stress of competing with healthy cattle.</p>
<p><img src="?hash=0f08a959be95918dcac3a3d4760aad05" /> <b>MEDICATIONS</b></p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">• Common antimicrobial classes used for treatment of BRD include penicillins, cephalosporins, oxytetracyclines, floroquinalones, macrolides.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">• Ancillary treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, antihistamines, and vitamin injections may be of value on a case-by-case basis</span>, but in general have limited application in treatment of BRD.</p>
<p><b>CONTRAINDICATIONS</b></p>
<p>• Some antibiotics are not approved for certain classes of cattle, such as lactating dairy cattle.</p>
<p>• Meat and milk withhold times must be considered before administrating any medication to food-producing cattle.</p>
<p><b>POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS</b></p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p><img src="?hash=3082804679e251b1b54535923e8732e9" /> <b>FOLLOW-UP</b></p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;"><b>PATIENT MONITORING</b></span></p>
<p>• Daily observation of attitude and appetite will provide a good indication of treatment success.</p>
<p>• <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">Gaining of weight</span> is associated with a good prognosis while continued weight loss is a poor sign.</p>
<p>• <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">Reduction of rectal temperature in 24–48 hours posttreatment</span> is associated with a good prognosis.</p>
<p><b>PREVENTION/AVOIDANCE</b></p>
<p>• Immunization against common pathogens associated with BRD</p>
<p>• Minimizing stressful events</p>
<p>• Maintaining well-ventilated and sanitary environments with plenty of bunk space and water availability</p>
<p><b>POSSIBLE COMPLICATIONS</b></p>
<p>• Pericarditis</p>
<p>• Endocarditis</p>
<p>• Pleuritis</p>
<p>• Polyarthritis is often a sequela of <em>Mycoplasma bovis</em> and <em>Haemophilus somnus</em> pneumonia.</p>
<p><b>EXPECTED COURSE AND PROGNOSIS</b></p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">• Prognosis is generally favorable if intervention occurs early.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">• If intervention is started early, most cattle respond to treatment in 24–72 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 250, 165);-evernote-highlight:true;">• Failure to respond to initial treatments generally indicates advanced disease and the prognosis should be guarded.</span></p>
